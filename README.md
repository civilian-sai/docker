1. First connect to the docker.
2. Then pull the mongo and mongo-express from the docker hub and then run them using specific credentials, ports and network and connect both mmongo and mongo-express.
3. Then now save the index.html and server.js in any of the platform and run the javascript file using NodeJS ( make sure its already pre-installed ).
4. Now you can see our front end is connected to backend, and this becomes a mini project.
5. And now we should convert all these resouces into image.
6. For generating an image you need to use the docker file or the docker compose file ( if you dont want to use the run commands repeatedly ).
7. Now build that docker file and it converts into an image.
8. Now you can push this image into any containerised platforms.
